**E-Commerce Sales Analysis — Power BI Dashboard**

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of an e-commerce company’s sales performance using Power BI. The goal of the dashboard is to uncover actionable insights across key business areas including sales, profit, shipping costs, customer markets, and product categories.
The visualizations are built from a structured Excel dataset and transformed into an interactive analytical report.

The analysis focuses on four major KPIs:
* **Total Sales:** 12.64M
* **Total Profit:** 1.47M
* **Total Quantity Sold:** 178K
* **Total Shipping Cost:** 1.35M

These Key Performance Indicator form the backbone of the report, helping assess overall business performance and operational efficiency.

A treemap visualization highlights:
* **England (485.17K) and California (457.69K)** leading state-wise performance.
